# CustomWebApp
ASP.NET Core Example

**To open** Clone/Download the master branch of the repository. Open 
CustomWebApp (either the sln or the csproj file). Run using ISS Express (Ctrl + F5, F5, or the Run button from withing Visual Studio).

## Features
Three Controllers, two of which capture form information and would generally use it to make a database query. I utilize custom data types to allow it to be functional without a Database hit. Since speed is a priority above all else I have focused on that, hopefully this presents at least C# copentency (Difficult to present skills without a good use case).

1. Search funtionality (Search Controller).
2. General logic of a login system (SigninController and User Model).
3. Simple redirects to pages (HomeController).

## Tech Stack
ASP.NET Core (HTML5, CSS3). JQuery due to usage of Bootstrap.
